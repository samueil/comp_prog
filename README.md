# What is this?

I like to solve programming problems! I'm not very good at it yet, but I'm trying. Sometimes I don't have access to my computer but would like to continue working on a problem, which is one of the main reasons this exists. 

In addition, as a novice competitive programmer, I know how useful it can be to compare my solutions to the solutions of others: my hope is that as I continue to solve problems and learn more skills, this repository can serve as an aid to people who are looking to discover ways that other programmers are solving similar problems.
